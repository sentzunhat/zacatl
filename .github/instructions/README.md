# Instructions Folder

Files in this folder must use the `*.instructions.md` suffix and include frontmatter with `applyTo`.

These files are for **automatic** Copilot guidance when matching files are in scope.

Current instruction files:

- `changelog.instructions.md` (applies to `docs/changelog.md` and `package.json`)
